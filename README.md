## Dataset
We use 4 batches of Human’s data, each with 8569 cells by 20125 gene/cell and 2 batches of mouse’s data, each with 1886 cells by 14878 gene/cell. The Human pancreatic islet dataset come from the GEO or EMBL-EBI database under the accession codes GSE81076, GSE85241, GSE86469, E-MTAB-5061, and GSE84133. Mice’s comes from the GEO database under the accession code GSE84133.
In the dataset, each row represents all gene expression of a cell, each column represents all cell’s gene expression of a certain gene. There are also barcode showing the origin of the cell and cell label showing ground truth cell type.
